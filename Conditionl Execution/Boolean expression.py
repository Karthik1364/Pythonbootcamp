# Boolean expression

# The python boolean type has only two possible values
# 1. True
# 2. False

# Boolean expressions are very crucial when it comes to conditional execution.

# If you want to check an expression, whether it's true or false, we are using operators.
# Now the first operator is "equal operator" which is "equal sign" (==) from math.

# "==" equal:
# so if you want to check that if two vaules are equal, we need to use equal sign over here.
# here you need to take into account that equal sign is different from the equal sign that we use in maths, i.e "=" this single sign we use it in the maths.
# But here in python, the equal sign is denoted by double equal "==" sign over here.
# for example. if I want to check an expression like this.

# Ex: 1
print(1 == 1) # in this case it returns True.

# note: single equal "=" sign in python is used as assignment operator.
# note: if you use "==" sign over here, it's becoming an expression.

# Ex: 2
print(1 == 2) # in this case it returns False.

# Ex: 3 
print(type(True)) # here the True belongs to "bool" type.
print(type(False)) # here the False belongs to "bool" type.
