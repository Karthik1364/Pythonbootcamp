# Nested Condition:

# means one condition can be also nested within another condition.

# example for the IF & ESLE:

# if condition: # if this first condition is True,
#   if another condition: # we are continuing to another if condition over here.
#       do this     # if this condition is ok will execute this.
#   else:
#       do this  # if not this condition will be executed inside the if condition.
# else:         
#   do this   # if the above "if inside if condition" is not correct, we will process with the outside else part.

# note: once the first condition has passed, we can check for another condition and then we can have another if/esle statement inside this if condition over here.
