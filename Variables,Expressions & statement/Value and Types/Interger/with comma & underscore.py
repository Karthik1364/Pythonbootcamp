# in many countries the large numbers comes this the (comma,) inbetween i.e 1,000,000 -> this won't work in python.
# it basically comes under the logical error (the code will run without error, but execute it wrongly).

print(1,000,000)

# instead of (comma,) if we use (underscore_) the i.e 1_000_000, it will execute properly, without any logical errors.

print(1_000_000)
