# A variable is a name that refers to a value. It is a name for a value for future use.
# a = 1, here a -> variable : 1 -> value : = -> assignment statement.
# so writing the name (equals to "=") the value is called assignment statement, which creates a new variable and give them value.
# the equal sign "=" used here is not the same as the equal sign that is used in maths, "=" is the assignment statement which means that it assigns this value to this variable over here.
# in future if we call this variable, it give the value againt that variable.
