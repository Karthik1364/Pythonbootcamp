# the operators are symbols that represent competitions like addition, multiplication or some other mathematical operations.

# + Addition
# - Substraction
# * Multiplication
# / Division

print(1 + 1)
print(3 - 2)
print(2 * 3)
print(4 / 2) # whenever we divide a number the result will always be in the floating point number (2.0).
print(4 // 2) # "//" if we want to ignore the floating number as the result (2).
print(5 ** 2) # by wiriting two asterisks "**" we can raise the number to the power of given second number.

# PEMDAS rule

# P = Parentheses
# E = Exponents
# M = Multiplication
# D = Division
# A = Addition
# S = Subtraction

## so by using this pemdas rule, we can identify the priority of the opertions in python as we have in mathematics.
## note: here multiplication and division are equally important, PEMD||AS, here PEMD is the priority and AS is secondary.

# Ex:
print(2*2+2/2-2)
