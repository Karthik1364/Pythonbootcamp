# operators in string

# "+" we can use plus operator for the string.
# "*" we can also use multiplication operator for the string.

#### using "+" sign:

# Ex: 1
print("Hello" + "Karthik") # in python we call it as concatenation.

# if you want to concatenate two string we can use "+" symbol.

#### using "*" symbol:

# Ex: 2
#print("Hello" * "Karthik") # here we cannot use "*" symbol for two strings.

# Ex: 3 
print("Hello " * 4) # we can use space, it is concatenating Hello three times.


### While we are working with operators, the most common word that we are using is expression.

## What is an Expression?

# An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so in a variable, so the following are all legal expressions.

# 20
# x
# x + 20

# Ex:
name = "karthik" # it is called an expression.
print(name *4)

#### so as the beginner you need to know whenever someone asks expression in python? 
###### everything relates to variables, operators and values are called expressions.
