# Round function in python.

# whenever we divide a number by another number, we always get floating number.
# it doesn't matter if this number is integer or float, but the result from the division will be float.

# Ex: 1
print(10/3)

# Ex: 2
print(10//3) # "//" is called float division used to ignore the decimal nummbers.

# Ex: 3
# if there is 3.5, we take it as 4, in that way we can use round function to round the decimal numbers.
print(round(10/3))

# Ex: 4
print(round(10/3,2)) # in this case we can bring the required decimal number by using (comma).

# Ex: 5 
print(round(3.53344555,3)) # not only in division but by providing the float number we can cut short the decimal number using round function.
