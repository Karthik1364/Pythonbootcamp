# comments in python.

# what is comments in python?

# Basically this is a kind of notes, we are adding to our course to remember things very easily.
# as programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to understand.
# so whenever we write a complex program, when we come back to our code in the future, if you have any problem, so it is very difficult to understand what is our code doing.
# so for those cases, python comments are very useful.
# basically if you want to write a comment in python, it starts with "#" symbol.

# The name variable takes name from console.
name = input("""What is your name? 
""")
print("Hello" + name)

# three reasons for using comments in our code:
# 1 : you can use the comments to explain the codes itself.
# 2 : we can make our code more readable.
# 3 : when you are testing the code you might want not to execute one part of code.

# note: by using the comment "#" symbol we can make a code as comment before or after execution.

# Ex: 2

a = 10*50/100
# b = 100
print()
